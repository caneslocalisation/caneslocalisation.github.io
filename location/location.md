For reference (presently), the cheapest place is simultaneously the closest (Strand Continental hostel), for which details can be found [here](http://www.booking.com/Share-HSJeEJ). </sub> <br />

<sub>It should become obvious from a cursory browse that many of these locations are rapidly filling up, so to avoid a nativity-style situation we'd recommend booking as soon as possible.</sub> <br />

<sub>Please bear in mind that anywhere close to a Northern (Charing Cross branch) or Bakerloo line tube station should do well, as the Strand campus is a ten minute walk from Charing Cross/Embankment. </sub>
